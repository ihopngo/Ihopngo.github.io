		<h2>Miranda V. Arizona</h2>
		<hr>

		<h3>Who was Ernesto Miranda?</h3>
		
		<p>Ernesto was born on March 9, 1941 in Mesa, Arizona. His father <i>Manual A. Miranda</i> was house
		painter who had immigranted to the U.S. and his mother was named <i>Cleopatra Miranda</i>. Together they
		would have 12 children, Ernesto being the 5th child who at age 6 would loose his mother leading to his
		father remarrying the following year. Ernesto and his father never got along, becoming distant with 
		his family, eventually in 8th grade being convicted of burglary and sentence to a reform school for 
		year. After he was released a month later he commited another crime causing him to return to the reform
		school, He later moved to California where he would be arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and sex
		offenses. He was in custody for two and a half years, after he would moved back to Arizona.</p>

		<h3>Police Line-up</h3>
		<p>Ernesto continued to go in and out of jails from multiple states inside the U.S. after going back
		Arizona, eventually he kept out of jail and worked for various jobs and lived with Twila Hoffman, a
		mother with a boy and a girl. Ernesto Miranda was arrested by Phoenix Police on March 13, 1963. Miranda was
		pointed out for the rape and kidnapping of an 18 year old. Police were pressing Miranda into
		speaking the truth. Police questioned him for two hours without informing him of 5th amendment
		right against self incrimination and his 6th amendment right to an attorney. Miranda signed a
		confession to the rape charge on a form stating that he is aware of his right of self incrimination
		even through he was never informed of it. He verbally confessed it as well. Miranda was never
		advised of his right to remain silent.</p>

		<h3>The Trial</h3>
		<p>At trial Miranda’s attorney argued that the confession was
		not actually voluntary because Miranda wasn’t aware of his rights. Miranda’s confession was
		used as evidence against him. He was convicted 20-30 years in Prison. Miranda appealed the
		case to the Arizona Supreme court. His defense attorney said that he was not advised of his
		right or counsel present through his questioning; his questioning should be excused at the trial.
		The Police admitted that Miranda’s rights weren’t read to him. The Court stated that Miranda
		should be aware of his rights because he convicted a crime beforehand. Miranda’s appeal was
		declined.</p>

		<h3>The Supreme Court</h3>
		<p>He took it to the United States Supreme Court. The Court Ruled under the 5th
		Amendment that the police must inform suspects of their right to stay silent and the right to an
		attorney while in police custody. Defendants must be informed that they have the right to remain
		silent, that anything they say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have a right
		to an attorney and if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. The Court also
		stated that people can waive their rights and can confess or make a statement. The decision
		was criticized at the time for providing criminals with further means to avoid punishment.
		Miranda was retried when finding new evidence and was still sentenced to 20-30 years in
		prison. He was let out after 5 years on parole. Ironically he was killed and the killer was told his
		<b>Mirranda Rights</b>, and never told the police anything, the killer fled to mexico and was never caught.</p>

		<!-- <h3>The Style</h3>
		<p>	In my website I tried to find a font that had a style related to the topic Miranda V. Arizona. Using the same method that I did in lab 3, I use two different fonts one is for the headings and other for the paragraph tags. Making the headings more pronouced with a bigger bold font style and for the paragraph elements I made the line-height 1.75rem for better readability. The background color of my webpage is white with black font which is really the only style I can think of that works with my essays content, the entire look of my webpage is inspired by the style of a newspaper with the font being a typewriter. I added a bit color to the header, nav and footer tags a light cyan with light coral complementary colors, overall I didn't know how to implement colors in an interesting way in my webpage. I made the main tags width 900px with left and right margins at auto, to keep the webpages content in the middle of the screen, instead of have the paragraphs go across the entire screen.</p>

		<h3>Html Abuse</h3>
		<p>In my original version of this html page I was using the align attribute to move my images around to put the images in places I like for them to be in. I also added &"nbsp"'s to add indents to my paragraphs in my html code and replaced it with the text-indent property.</p> -->
