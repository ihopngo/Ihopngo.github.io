            <h2>Borzoi Information</h2>
            <p>Among the most impressively beautiful of all dogs, the aristocratic Borzoi is cherished for his calm, agreeable temperament. In full stride, he is a princely package of strength, grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour. Borzoi are large, elegant sighthounds. A mature male stands at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 105 pounds. Females will be smaller. Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction follows the ancient Greyhound template. One known as the Russian Wolfhound, Borzoi were bred to be swift and tough enough to pursue and pin their ferocious lupine quarry. In their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room is a must.</p>

            <!-- <h2>My Addendum:</h2>
            <p>With my JavaScript section I wanted to do a very simple yes or no question asking about a borzoi nose, but after doing that i decided to learn how to make a random number generator in between two input that a use provides. Learning to impletment JavaScript is very new to me, the way it works is very similar to programming languages like python and C++, but learning the way functions and Java works was challenging.</p> -->
