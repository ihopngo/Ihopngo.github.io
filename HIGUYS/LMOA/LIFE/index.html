            <!-- <h2>My Addendum:</h2>
            <p>I started this project very late and close to the due date, leading to a very simple story with multiple endings that aren't really well thought out and taken seriously. The story was created within a hour or more, but I made a planned chart showing the paths that a user takes leading to outcomes and consequences they chose. I struggled understanding JavaScript's way of code, having expeirence with Python I find them similar, yet I found it hard translating it to JavaScript. I knew how I wanted to make it work, but had a hard time thinking of ways to write the story information something exclusivly in JavaScript, it lead to research about how a text adventure game would look like. I felt like I didn't know anything about JavaScript seeing how a person solved their problem. I finally started my script.js and after a week of research and debugging I started to properly write my text adventure and understand how I could solve my problem. Once I got the functions working and properly calling the correct functions, showing the right endImages, determining if collar is on or off in specific endings etc. I was able to write the story with no problems. I have no doubt there is a better way to write what I made thats more efficient, but overall I learned a lot about Javascript having very little expeirence actually coding before this project.</p> -->
