            <h2>My Addendum:</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of this project I thought I had a good idea of the solution for the game, but how wrong I was. I was originally planning on using a list of buttons then using CSS to put them into a grid display, but eventually scrapped that idea. Another idea I found was through looking at a lights out game on google using inspect I planned to learn about < td >, but found it useless. This project was difficult more than I originally thought it was going to be, I eventually found through a video creating grid values within JavaScript and a div created my grid with the help of CSS. Creating the function to turn-off the square looks easy now, but it took so long to figure it out. Now I was able to turn on/off, but knowing python using math.random() was neccessary but I had no idea how to implement it. So now I had a random layout, I still had no idea if it was solveable, so I moved on to doing the plus shape when turning off lights and what not. I got that to work after while, so actually playing the game I realized that the game was giving me unsolvable layouts, which was really the most fustrating part during this whole project, at times it would work because of the random(), but not perfect, right now I think its fixed it works so far i've been getting solvable layouts. Overall the assignment took forever, I was able to really focus on it due to classes ending, but it took so much time. Everything I didn't mention such as the styles were simple compared to everything else. The project is fun and cool now that its done, but it required a lot of research similar to my midterm project but I did learn a lot through doing this project, it forced me to do new things with JavaScript rather than relying on buttons or if else statements.</p>
