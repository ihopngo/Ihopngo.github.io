		<p>Before I started any research into how to add a custom font thats not standard on every computer. I thought of the way I could do it before researching, I thought about downloading the specific font I wanted to add to my webpage from a font wesbite and uploading that to my repository. I went to youtube and looked up how to upload my font to my webpage, this channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ieatwebsites" target="_blank">iEatWebsites</a> showed me how to use the @font-face selector with a dowloaded .ttf file. The way he showed me was exactly how I thought it would work, I'm sure there is a multiple different ways to achieve adding a custom font to a webpage, but this solution was how I envisioned it. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAU25Fo4bFY" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> went through the selector on @font-face.</p>
