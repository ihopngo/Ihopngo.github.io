            <!-- <h2>My Addendum:</h2>
            <p>With my JavaScript section I wanted to do a very simple yes or no question asking about a borzoi nose, but after doing that i decided to learn how to make a random number generator in between two input that a use provides. Learning to impletment JavaScript is very new to me, the way it works is very similar to programming languages like python and C++, but learning the way functions and Java works was challenging.</p> -->
